Rules:
  Each player has 3 lanes of 2 card slots (2 rows) and starts with 5 cards in hand.
  Every turn, each player plays any 2 cards from hand, face down, on either the Back Row or Front Row
  When everyone is finished, all players do the following in parallel:
  - Reveal all facedown cards
  - Each player fights a random player:
    - In a fight, each player sums the cards powers on each lane
    - Each of the lanes fights the opposite lane
    - For each lane, whoever has the highest lane power gets 1 victory point
  - Slide all Back Row cards to the Front Row (except Spells, Persistent cards, etc). Any Front Row cards are destroyed if replaced.
  - Draw 2 cards
  
  The game ends after 9 rounds.
  
Warlords: |
    
    Each Warlord has a deck of 6 cards that are always drawn in the same order.
    On draw phase, you can choose to draw a Warlord card instead of a normal card out of the 2 drawn cards.
    Warlord cards are more thematic and powerful.
